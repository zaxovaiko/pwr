## What is Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elem
ents to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now
one of the world’s most popular markup languages.
Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like M
icrosoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are
visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdownformatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and p
hrases should look different.
